### Documentation

You may find out about the documentation [here](https://github.com/...Usecases.md)

## Technologies

The application is built with the following technologies:

- [.NET 7.0](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/whats-new/dotnet-7)

## Local Development

### Prerequisites

- .NET 7.0 SDK

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Navigate to the root directory of the project in the terminal:

   ```bash
   cd CharityDonations.Api
   ```

3. Restore the project dependencies:

   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   ```

4. Build the application:

   ```bash
   dotnet build
   ```

5. Run the application:

   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

   The application runs on [`http://localhost:5073/`](http://localhost:5073/).

### Starting sql server with docker

If you don't have docker installed and running on your machine, go ahead and [install docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/).

Verify if docker is running by checking the version of your docker

```bash
docker --version
```

To see docker containers that are currently running run the following command:

```bash
docker ps
```

Go ahead and run the following commands to pull Microsoft SQL Server image from docker hub and start it as a container on your machine:

```bash
$sa_password = "[YOUR SA PASSWORD HERE]"
docker run -e "ACCEPT_EULA=Y" -e "MSSQL_SA_PASSWORD=$sa_password" -p 1433:1433 -v sqlvolume:/var/opt/mssql -d --rm --name mssql mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2022-latest
```

Run `docker ps` to see the container.

If you want to stop the container, you can run `docker stop mssql`. You can also restart the container by running the docker run command above.

### saving connection string to secret manager

Instead of defining connection string in appsettings.json, we are using SecretManager provided by .NET to store our connection strings

```bash
$sa_password = "[YOUR SA PASSWORD HERE]"
dotnet user-secrets set "ConnectionStrings: CharityOrganizationsContext" "Server=localhost; Database=CharityOrganizations; User Id=sa; Password=$sa_password;TrustServiceCertificate=true"
```

Notice that the sa password is the one that you set before when configuring mssql server. If this command is successfuly excuted, you will see a message, "successfully saved ConnectionStrings... to the secret store".

To see the list of your secrets, run

```bash
dotnet user-secrets list
```

   cd charity-donations
   cd CharityDonations.Api
   ```

   The application runs on [`http://localhost:5073/`](http://localhost:5073/).

### Starting sql server with docker

# install docker

If you don't have docker installed and running on your machine, go ahead and [install docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/).

# pull mssql server docker image

Pull Microsoft SQL Server image from docker hub and start it as a container on your machine:

```bash
$sa_password = "[YOUR SA PASSWORD HERE]"
docker run -e "ACCEPT_EULA=Y" -e "MSSQL_SA_PASSWORD=$sa_password" -p 1433:1433 -v sqlvolume:/var/opt/mssql -d --rm --name mssql mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2022-latest
```

Run `docker ps` to see the container.

Run `docker stop mssql` whenever you want to stop the container.

Run the "docker run..." command above whenever you want to restart the container.

# safe storage of connection string to .NET secret manager

Instead of defining connection string in appsettings.json, we are using SecretManager provided by .NET to safely store our connection strings

```bash
$sa_password = "[YOUR SA PASSWORD HERE]"
dotnet user-secrets set "ConnectionStrings: CharityOrganizationsContext" "Server=localhost; Database=CharityDonationsApi; User Id=sa; Password=$sa_password;TrustServerCertificate=True"
```

Notice that the sa password is the one that you set before when configuring mssql server. If this command is successfuly excuted, you will see a message, "successfully saved ConnectionStrings... to the secret store".

To see the list of your secrets, run

```bash
dotnet user-secrets list
```
